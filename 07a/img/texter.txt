To truly understand photography, one needs to understand light and how it can be sculpted and manipulated to form an accurate representation of the mind's eye. Many times during my initial outings, I would give up, sure that the clouds wouldn't break and that the sun had disappeared for good, only to witness the most spectacular of skies whilst on the journey home. This element of chance only added to the excitement, spurring me on to stay, until the very last ray of sunlight had dropped beneath the darkening horizon.

Even though, when photographing landscapes now I plan my trips carefully and try and assess the weather days in advance, I usually find that my favourite and most personal images are born from an unexpected moment, where everything that needs to come together does; a realisation that has taught me to always have a camera to hand.

I share this passion for nature with a love of the human form. The expressiveness and individuality of the human body provides endless photographic opportunities. My figurative work focuses on the relationship that we have with our surroundings and places the individual as close to nature as possible.

I believe it is possible to draw parallels between our form and evolution with that of the landscape that surrounds us. This connection is innate and can be awoken when stimulated by nature. It is this bond between humankind and its milieu that I try and portray in my figurative work.
