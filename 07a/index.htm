            To truly understand photography, one needs to understand light and
            how it can be sculpted and manipulated to form an accurate
            representation of the mind's eye. Many times during my initial
            outings, I would give up, sure that the clouds wouldn't break and
            that the sun had disappeared for good, only to witness the most
            spectacular of skies whilst on the journey home. This element of
            chance only added to the excitement, spurring me on to stay, until
            the very last ray of sunlight had dropped beneath the darkening
            horizon.

          <p>
            Even though, when photographing landscapes now I plan my trips
            carefully and try and assess the weather days in advance, I usually
            find that my favourite and most personal images are born from an
            unexpected moment, where everything that needs to come together
            does; a realisation that has taught me to always have a camera to
            hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I share this passion for nature with a love of the human form. The
            expressiveness and individuality of the human body provides endless
            photographic opportunities. My figurative work focuses on the
            relationship that we have with our surroundings and places the
            individual as close to nature as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe it is possible to draw parallels between our form and
            evolution with that of the landscape that surrounds us. This
            connection is innate and can be awoken when stimulated by nature. It
            is this bond between humankind and its milieu that I try and portray
            in my figurative work.
